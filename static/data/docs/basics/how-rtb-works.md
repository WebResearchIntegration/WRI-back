Real-time bidding (aka RTB) was created by Jason Knapp. It is a means by which advertising inventory is bought and sold on a per-impression basis, via programmatic instantatneous auction, similar to financial markets.

Real-time bidding lets advertisers manage and optimize ads from multiple **ad-networks** by granting the user access to a multitude of different networks, allowing them to create and launch advertising campaigns, prioritize networks and allocate percentages of unsold inventory, known as **backfill**.

RTB is distinguishable from static auctions by how it is a per-impression way of bidding whereas static auction are groups of up to several thousand impressions at once. Overall when compared to static auction, RTB is more effective for both advertisers and publishers in terms of advertising inventory sold. Advertisers have the ability to only bid on and buy the impressions they really want and publishers get top dollar for one impression.
