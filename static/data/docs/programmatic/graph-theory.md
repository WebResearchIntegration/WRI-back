# Graph Theory

Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph is made up of **vertices**, **nodes** or points which are connected by **edges**, arcs or lines. A graph may be **undirected**, meaning that there is no distinction between the two vertices associated with each edge, or its edges may be **directed** from one vertex to another.

A graph is an ordered pair **G=(V,E)** comprising a set V of vertices together wth a set E of edges. V and E are usually taken to be finite. The **order** of a graph is |V|, it's number of vertices. The **size** of a graph is |E| its number of edges. The **degree of valency** of a vertex is the number of edges that connect to it, where an edge that connects a vertex to itself (**a loop**) is counted twice.
